# Automatic Detection of Indoor Space Occupation


  Problem: 
The automatic detection of occupancy in buildings can be successfully used in implementing energy-saving strategies. However, due to privacy concerns, the installation of surveillance cameras is often not feasible. Therefore, it is necessary to indirectly monitor the presence of occupants in an indoor space. To achieve this, sensors for measuring humidity, temperature, light, and carbon dioxide were placed in the monitored space. Over a period of time, data recorded by these sensors, along with indications of the presence or absence of occupants at various times of the day, were collected.
The aim of this study is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model, supported by the Random Forest algorithm, that will enable the automatic detection of occupancy in the space in question in the future, based on the information provided by these sensors.

  Tasks to be performed:
• Implement the solution to the stated problem in a Jupyter Notebook document, developing a high-performance ML model using the data provided in the dataset.csv file that fully complies with the described specifications. [generate solution.ipynb]
• With the developed model, classify the observations in the dataset_naoclassificado.csv file for which the true classification is not disclosed. [generate estimated classification.csv]
